# If we look at the cast/3, we can see that it will take
# 1. our struct
# 2. our params map
# 3. and a list of allowed fields,
#    and returns a changeset struct that is either valid or invalid.
#    It is valid if all of the allowed fields (the 3rd argument to the function) were able to be successfully converted
#        to their respective type according the struct given to it.
#    (The function can work on other data as well, but letâ€™s   keep things simple).

# def changeset - marks the changset as valid if all the fields in the second argument are present in the changeset.
# It marks the changeset invalid if any one of the fields is missing,
# adding the correct message(s) to the errors field of the changeset.
